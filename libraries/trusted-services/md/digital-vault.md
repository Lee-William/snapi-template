      Secure Authentication  
    </h5>
    <p class="gov-led-desc">
      By calling secure APIs of NDI, applications from private businesses and public sector can soon authenticate users with better assurances on their Identity. 
	  Forget the pain of developing custom authentication solutions, NDI gives you seem-less integration options through Open Standards. Reduce the risk of foul-play, 
	  2FA is intrinsic to NDI Authentication.

      Consent on User’s Personal Information
    </h5>
    <p class="gov-led-desc">
      Access your user’s trusted data in NDI platform with their real time consent.  
	  All your user will need to do is to allow your business to access itemized aspects of their personal information, 
	  this will be as simple as an NDI login using fingerprint to their smart device followed by sharing information with your business through the click of a button, 
	  triggered from your application.

      National Digital Identity for transactions (...not just payments)
    </h5>
    <p class="gov-led-desc">
      Its about time that Singapore forgets waiting on queue numbers for carrying out transactions which require physical presence, 
	  because NDI is about to open up ‘government grade’ identity assurance to private businesses. 
	  Why open customer service counters, when you can get the job done with an NDI integrated application?
