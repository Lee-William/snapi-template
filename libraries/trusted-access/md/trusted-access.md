    <p>
      The Trusted Access layer supports an <strong>open</strong> and <strong>federated</strong> ecosystem of Authentication Services Providers (ASPs).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Government will operate one of the ASPs, but other ASPs may be operated by private sectors, all referencing the same digital identity issued to individuals.

      Common Trust Framework
    </h5>
    <p>
      To support an ecosystem of federated ASPs, trust service providers and consumers, there is a need for a common trust framework.
    </p>
    <p>
    This framework will include:
    <ul>
      <li> the necessary facilitative legislation
      <li> process and cybersecurity standards consistent with industry and international standards
      <li> technical references to clearly stipulate the interactions between systems within this trust ecosystem
    </ul>

      NDI will support multiple and complementary authentication factors, including:
